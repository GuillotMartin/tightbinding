# A tight-binding Hamiltonian constructor

This package is design to help the creation of tight-binding Hamiltonians matrices depending on mulriple parameters. It also provides interactive plotting functions taht can be run in jupyter notebook to facilitate the study of band and eigenvectors structures.

## Installation

First download the repository and extract it where you want. Then, run in your python environment 

`bash`
pip install path\\to\\package\\tightbinding

or 

`bash`
pip install -e path\\to\\package\\tightbinding

if you want to be able to modify it in place.

## Getting started

Once you have installed the package, open in a jupyter viewer the [Getting Started](docs/GettingStarted.ipynb) notebook.
